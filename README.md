## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to solutions for problems sourced exclusively from **LeetCode**. Each problem is solved using optimal approaches in multiple programming languages where necessary, with a focus on:

- **Time Complexity**
- **Space Complexity**
- **Scalability**

You can find my LeetCode profile [here](https://leetcode.com/u/FirozMars/).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized based on problem categories from LeetCode:

```bash
.
├── Arrays
├── Strings
├── LinkedList
├── Trees
├── Graphs
├── DynamicProgramming
├── Recursion
├── Backtracking
├── SortingAndSearching
├── Greedy
└── README.md
```

Each folder corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm type. Inside each folder, you'll find subfolders for each problem, containing solutions in one or more programming languages.

### Example Folder Structure:

```bash
Arrays/
    ├── TwoSum_Solution.cpp
    ├── TwoSum_Solution.java
    └── TwoSum_Solution.py
```

## How to Use

You can browse the folders to find problems based on topic or difficulty level. Each solution is labeled with the problem name, its description, and an explanation of the approach taken.

- Each solution file has a clear **problem statement** as a comment.
- Solutions are optimized for **runtime** and **memory usage** where possible.

### Problem Tags

Each problem solution is tagged with the following metadata:

- **Difficulty**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Approach**: Brute Force, Optimized Solution
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity breakdown

## Technologies Used

This repository contains solutions written in:

- **C++**
- **Java**
- **Python**

You can choose the programming language that suits your preference.
